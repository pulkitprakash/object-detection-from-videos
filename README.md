# Image Feature Extraction using LBPs and SILTPs

This repository contains the implementation of two powerful image feature extraction techniques: Linear Binary Patterns (LBPs) and Scale-Invariant Local Ternary Patterns (SILTPs). These methods are widely used in computer vision for tasks such as texture classification, face recognition, and image segmentation.

## Linear Binary Patterns (LBPs)

LBPs are a type of feature used for classification in computer vision. LBPs summarize the local spatial structure of an image by comparing each pixel with its surrounding neighborhood of pixels. The result is a binary number that represents the texture around that pixel.

## Scale-Invariant Local Ternary Patterns (SILTPs)

SILTPs extend the idea of LBPs to be more robust against changes in illumination and scale. Instead of using a binary code, SILTPs use a ternary code to capture the relationship between a pixel and its neighbors.
